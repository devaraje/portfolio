      <h1>French-pressed vs drip coffee?</h1>
      
      <p>Many coffee purists will argue that brewing coffee using a <strong>French press</strong>
        is the only <br>way to brew coffee since it is far more accurate and all of the flavors and         oils grounds <br>are enhanced while the coffee is brewing. There are several factors that           give French <br>presses an advantage over their automatic cousins.
      </p>
      
      <p>The French press is a great way to make strong and delicious coffee at home!</p>

      <h1>Coffee Shops in Kirland WA</h1>
      
      <p>As I was strolling by the Kirkland waterfront at about <time>15:00</time> on a wet                 <br>Saturday afternoon, I was looking for not just a good cup of coffee but a cozy corner
        <br>in a cafe to sit down and enjoy my drink while surfing the web or doing my homework.
