            <p>HIV is one of the leading priorities of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The goal of our program is to support efforts to reduce the global incidence of HIV significantly and sustainably, and to help people infected with HIV lead long, healthy, and productive lives. We focus our efforts in the poorest hyper-endemic countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, where we believe our resources can have the greatest impact. To date, the foundation has committed more than US$2.5 billion in HIV grants to organizations around the world. We have also committed more than US$1.4 billion to the Global Fund. Beyond our direct investments in HIV, we advocate for sustained and increased funding for HIV service delivery.</p>
